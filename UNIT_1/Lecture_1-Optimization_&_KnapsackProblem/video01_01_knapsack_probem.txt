Computational Models:

  Opt. Models: Solvin lots of computations. Find the bigger/smaller
    An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized.
    A set of constraints (possibly empty) that must be honored
    
  Takeaways
    - Many problems of real importance ca be formulated as an optimization problem
    - Reducing a seeemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows to use pre-existing methods for 
    solving them
    - Solving optimization problems is computationally challenging  
    - A greedy algorithm is often a good enough aproximation of the solution of an optimization problem. 
    
  The knapsack problem
    You have limited strength, so there is a maximum weight knapsack that you can carry
    
    You would like to take more sturff than you can carry
    
    How do you choose which stuff to take and wich to leave behind
    
    Two variants:
      0/1 knapsack problem --->
        Is inherently exponential
      Continuous or fractional knapsack problem,
  
    Brute force algorithm [way of solving it]
      Enumerate all psoible combinatino of item.  POWER SET
      Remove all of the comibination whose total units exceeds the allowed wight.
      From the remaining combinations choose any on whose value is the largest
