Prerequisites:

  Experience writing object-oriented programs in Python
  Familiarity with concepts of computational complexity
    Un programa es practico dependiendo de su performance
  Familiarity with some simple algorithms
  6.00.1x its enough
  
How does it compare to 6.00.1x?
  
  Programming assignment a bit easier
    Focus more on the problem to be solved than on programming
  Lecture content more abstract
  Less about learning to program, more about dipping your toe into data science
  
Why take 6.00.2x?

  Become a better programmer
  Begin to learn about making productive use of data
    Statistical thinking
    Using appropriate packages
    
Honing your programming skills
